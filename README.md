## Problem Statement

Audible offered me a 3 months special offer before I click the unsubscribe button. I thought it was a great deal and continued to subscribe for another three months. That enticed me to think about whether the offer is provided to every churning customer? And if that is not the case, how does Audible knows who to give the offer to? Is there a way a company segment their customers and provide special offers to certain cluster since that cluster is more valuable to them? 

## Project Overview

* Performed exploratory data analysis and created plots for KPIs such as Growth Rate and Monthly Retention Rate  
* Measured Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) on customer dataset
* Applied unsupervised K-Means Clustering to segment customers into 3 different groups  

## [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Peter-Chong/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Notebooks/Data%20Transformation%20%26%20EDA.ipynb)

It is important that we can observe some of the important key performance indicators from the dataset and draw some insights.  
  
In the bar and line graph below, we can see that the revenue are cyclical. The company's revenue peaks at the end of both years. The reason for this phenomenon might due to 2 reasons. Either the companies sell a lot of Christmas or new year related product, or the company holds clearance every end of the year. More business contexts are required to understand this phenomenon.
