## Problem Statement

Audible offered me a 3 months special offer before I click the unsubscribe button. I thought it was a great deal and continued to subscribe for another three months. That enticed me to think about whether the offer is provided to every churning customer? And if that is not the case, how does Audible knows who to give the offer to? Is there a way a company segment their customers and provide special offers to certain cluster since that cluster is more valuable to them? 

## Project Overview

* Performed exploratory data analysis and created plots for KPIs such as Growth Rate and Monthly Retention Rate  
* Measured Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) on customer dataset
* Applied unsupervised K-Means Clustering to segment customers into 3 different groups
